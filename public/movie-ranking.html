<h3>Coach Carter</h3>
<p>
  Coach Carter is a sports drama based on the true story of Ken Carter, a high
  school basketball coach who prioritizes academics and discipline over
  athletics, even benching his undefeated team for poor grades. The film
  highlights themes of responsibility, teamwork, and the importance of education
  in breaking cycles of poverty and hardship.

<h3>Scary Movie</h3>
<p>
  The plot follows a group of teenagers being stalked by a mysterious killer
  while dealing with their own ridiculous antics and over-the-top stereotypes.
  Filled with outrageous gags and pop culture references, the film turns classic
  horror tropes into laugh-out-loud moments.
